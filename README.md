# Project 3 - *Yelp Client*

**Yelp Client** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Modal filter view that filters by type of food

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Customizing UI elements, such as colors, programatically
2. Implementing events and protocols

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Challenges that I encountered were customizing the UI and getting used ot auto layout.
